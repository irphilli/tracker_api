```

## Eager Loading

See Pivotal Tracker API [documentation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api#Response_Controlling_Parameters) for how to use the `fields` parameter.

```ruby
client = TrackerApi::Client.new(token: 'my-api-token')                    # Create API client

client.project(project_id, fields: ':default,labels(name)')               # Eagerly get labels with a project
client.project(project_id, fields: ':default,epics')                      # Eagerly get epics with a project
client.project(project_id).stories(fields: ':default,tasks')              # Eagerly get stories with tasks
story.comments(fields: ':default,person')                                 # Eagerly get comments and the person that made the comment for a story
```

## Error Handling
`TrackerApi::Errors::ClientError` is raised for 4xx HTTP status codes  
`TrackerApi::Errors::ServerError` is raised for 5xx HTTP status codes

## Warning

Direct mutation of an attribute value skips coercion and dirty tracking. Please use direct assignment or the specialized add_* methods to get expected behavior.
https://github.com/solnic/virtus#important-note-about-member-coercions

This will cause coercion and dirty tracking to be bypassed and the new label will not be saved.
```ruby
story = project.story(847762630)

label = TrackerApi::Resources::Label.new(name: 'Special Snowflake')
# BAD
story.labels << label
story.save

# GOOD
story.labels = story.labels.dup.push(label)
story.save
```

## TODO

- Add missing resources and endpoints
- Add create, update, delete for resources
- Error handling for [error responses](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api#Error_Responses)

## Semantic Versioning
http://semver.org/

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
